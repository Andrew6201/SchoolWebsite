    <h1>HOW MANY STUDY PLACES CAN YOU ACCEPT?</h1>
    <h4>ONE STUDY PLACE PER TERM PROVISION</h4>
    <p>
        According to this provision, a student may accept only one study place leading to a higher education degree in Finland in education that begins in the same academic term. This rule applies to all higher education.
    </p>
    <p>
        Higher education degrees included in the provision are:
        <ul>
            <li>Bachelor degrees and Master degrees awarded by Finnish universities of applied sciences</li>
            <li>Bachelor degrees and Master degrees awarded by Finnish universities</li>
            <li>Licentiate and Doctoral degrees awarded by Finnish universities</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The provision applies to higher education regardless of how the studies are provided. For example, if you have accepted a study place from a separate application, you cannot accept a study place from the joint application in the same term.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only exceptions to the provision are:
        <ul>
            <li>Transfer student selections</li>
            <li>the Ã…land Polytechnic</li>
            <li>the Police College of Finland</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, the provision cannot be applied to studies completed at foreign higher education institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The academic term (from 1 August to 31 December or 1 January to 31 July) is the set framework for implementation. The provision does not prevent acceptance of a place in another degree programme during another academic term. Even if the student postpones the commencement of studies, or interrupts his/her studies, that student cannot accept another study place for a degree programme starting in the same academic term.
